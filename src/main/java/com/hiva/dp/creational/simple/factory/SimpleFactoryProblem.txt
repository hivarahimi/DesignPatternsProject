Problem: Bank Card Management System
Problem Description:
You are required to implement a simple system for managing bank cards.
In this system, various types of bank cards exist, such as:
credit cards,
debit cards,
prepaid cards,
and so on.

Requirements:
The main structure of the system consists of entities Card and CardFactory.
Card is an interface that includes functions like getCardType() to return the type of the card.
For each different type of card, a class implementing this interface should be created.
CardFactory is a class responsible for creating instances of different types of cards.
It returns an instance of the corresponding class based on the input card type.
For example,
classes like CreditCard, DebitCard, PrepaidCard, etc.,
should be created to represent different types of cards.
Details:
Each bank card may have its own functionality and specific features.
For instance, a credit card might have the ability to make payments from a specific account,
whereas a debit card might deduct funds from a different account.
Utilizing the CardFactory and this pattern,
you can easily create the desired type of card without complicating your code.
This problem can help you understand and implement the Factory Pattern.
